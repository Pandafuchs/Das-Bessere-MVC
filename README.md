lightweight-php-mvc-framework
=============================

Just a little php framework. I am using this framework in different web-applications.
It is very easy to use.

Folder-structure: 
-
- class      : contains important classes (inheritance and dependencies).
- controller : contains all controllers. There you can add your logic.
- model      : contains all models.
- view       : contains all views.

Documentation:
-
I did not documentated this code so far, because it is very lightweight and easy to understand. If you are interested in UML-diagrams for a better understanding feel free to send me a message. If they are needed, i will create them for you.
